Extend the existing cruise booking form app with the following new features and entities. Keep the same tech stack (React + Node/Express + database) and maintain mobile-responsive, clean UI.
New core entity: Cruise

Admin can create, edit, list, and delete Cruises.
Each Cruise has:
Name, optional dates/description.
One selected Form Template (from existing templates).
Generated unique shareable link (e.g., /fill/cruise/:cruiseId).

Public form link now points to a specific Cruise and uses its associated Template.

New form step type: Multi-choice with quantity & price

In the Form Builder, add a new step type: "Multi-choice with Quantity".
Admin configures:
Question/header.
List of choices (buttons), each with:
Label (e.g., "Small Shirt", "Medium Shirt", "No thanks").
Price per unit (number, can be 0).
Optional initial quantity limit (stock cap).

User view:
Buttons displayed horizontally/vertically.
For each choice (except "No thanks" style), show + / - quantity selector (default 0).
"No thanks" or similar can be a simple button with quantity 0.
Next/Back as before.


On submission: Store individual answers + aggregate quantities per choice across all submissions for that Cruise.

Admin Dashboard – Cruises page (main overview)

List all Cruises with summary cards:
Cruise name, template name, signup count, submission notifications badge.

Click into Cruise detail view:
Table of quantity items: Auto-generated rows for every quantity-enabled choice across the template.
Columns: Item label, price, current total quantity ordered, limit (editable field), remaining stock.
If limit reached (total ≥ limit), automatically disable that choice in the live form for new users.

List of submitted clients:
Name, phone (required field – make phone number mandatory in all templates or enforce globally).
Quick view of their full form answers.
Count of total signups.

New submission notifications (simple badge or list).


Admin navigation

Separate clear sections/tabs:
Cruises (main overview + management as above).
Form Templates (existing builder + CRUD + duplicate).


Data updates

Submissions now linked to specific Cruise ID.
Aggregated totals computed and stored/updated on each submission.
Phone number field required globally (add validation).

Prioritize the Cruises dashboard and new quantity step type first. Keep the graph-based builder intact and simply add the new step type to it
